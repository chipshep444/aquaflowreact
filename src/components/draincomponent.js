                            <p>When drains and sewer lines back up it's very frustrating. There are different reasons for clogs. Mainline sewer its roots, grease, tampons, in smaller lines like lavatory sinks, tubs &amp; showers its usually hair and soap buildup. In kitchen sinks, mostly it is food from the disposal and grease, these are the most common reasons for backups in a house today.</p>
                            <p>At AquaFlow Plumbing we have years of experience in unclogging &amp; cleaning sewer and drain lines. We use state of the art equipment. General drain machines and or a hydro jetter.</p>

Roots commonly cause clogs which require professional sewer line cleaning from a professional Orlando sewer line cleaning company, like AquaFlow Plumbing.</p>
